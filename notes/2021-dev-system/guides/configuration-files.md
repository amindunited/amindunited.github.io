# Configuration Files

## dot Files

You may come across references to files that are prefixed with a '`.`'. For example '.js.config', '.editor', or '.rules'.

These are 'hidden' configuration files. Some file systems will hide file that are prefixed with '.'.

You can often change the settings in your file browser to make them visible, or view them in the [Terminal](./terminal.md) by listing the directory contents (`ls`) using the `-a` flag (`-a` is shorthand for 'all').
```BASH
ls -a
```


## RC Files

You may see files that are named with a the suffix 'rc'. Files like '.bashrc', '.nvmrc', '.eslintrc'.

The 'rc' at the end of a file is related to the phrase "run commands". It comes from older Unix 
systems.
