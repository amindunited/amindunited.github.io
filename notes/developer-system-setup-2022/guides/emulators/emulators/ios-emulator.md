# IOS Simulator

Xcode (developer tools) from the app store
then the command-line tools (this takes a long time):

xcode-select --install
Once Xcode is installed a link to the Ios simulator can be created by launching xcode:
  - Selecting 'xcode' menu -> 'Open Developer Tool' -> 'simulator'.
  - Once the simulator is open, drag its icon from the Launcher into the 'Applications' directory
