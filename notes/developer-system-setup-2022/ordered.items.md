## Universal Package Manager

To learn about [Package Mangers](./guides/package-managers.md#package-managers)

_or_

If you are on a Mac and need to install

[Homebrew](./guides/package-managers.md#Homebrew)

## Development Environments

  ### Terminal

  If you don't know about the terminal you can find out more [here](./guides/terminal.md#terminal) including alternate Terminal options like: 
  [iTerm2 (macOs)](./guides/terminal.md#installing-a-terminal-emulator) or
  [Terminator (Linux)](./guides/terminal.md#installing-a-terminal-emulator).

  Otherwise you might want to install an [Alternate Shell](./guides/terminal.md#shell) like [Zsh](./guides/terminal.md#zsh) (Already installed on macOS)

  And add some script, plugins and themes with [Oh-My-Zsh](./guides/oh-my-zsh.md).

  ### IDE
  
  If you know that you want [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  There are also some plugins, and config notes [here](./guides/ide/vs-code/index.md)

  ### Virtualisation

  Probably the most popular container / virtualisation option is [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/).

  note: (The docker desktop install includes the `docker-cli` and `docker compose`)

  ### Emulator
  [IOS Simulator](./guides/emulators/emulators/ios-emulator.md)
