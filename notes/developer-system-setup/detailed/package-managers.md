Homebrew is a package manager for macOS which lets you install free and open-source software using your terminal.

If you are on Linux, you already have one, but you can still install homebrew.

If you are on OS X, you need Homebrew

If you are using Windows

One line install:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
