# Repositories

A base (or source) respository is the repositoy that holds the original code.

Sometimes a contributer can checkout this repository and make changes directly on it, but it is good practice to Fork the repository.

Forking a repository creates a new copy of the repository that is yours. On your fork you can make any changes that you like, you can branch, commit, push without affecting anyone else.
