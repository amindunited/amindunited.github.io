# Code Hosting

Now that we have [git](./dcvs-git.md), we'll want somewhere to store the code. Especially if we want to share it.

Just sign up for a free account with any of these providers (but really, use [Github](https://github.com/)):

1. [Github](https://github.com/)
2. [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
3. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

It is also possible that you work for a company that hosts their own git instance. Just follow their directions to setup.


## You will also want to set up ssh keys for that account

  Make sure that you have a [public ssh key](./ssh-keys.md)
