# Xcode 

Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) that you use to build apps for Apple products including the iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Mac. Xcode provides tools to manage your entire development workflow.

Although, at the time of writing, there are much better IDEs for web development, Installing xcode will quickly add a lot other tools that will be useful as a developer.

### Source Control: Git and Subversion
The Xcode IDE supports both of these SCM systems directly within the IDE, and makes them available from the command line.

### UNIX tools
These include all of the most popular command line tools such as make, awk, sed, ssh, tar, and zip.

### Editors
The editors in macOS include TextEdit, xed (the Xcode editor), plus vim and emacs.


### IOS Simulators
Simulate iPhones, iPads, and the appleWatch on your development Machine.


## Install Xcode

  ```sh
  xcode-select --install
  ```

## Simulators

Once Xcode is installed a link to the Ios simulator can be created by launching xcode:
  - Selecting 'xcode' menu -> 'Open Developer Tool' -> 'simulator'.
  - Once the simulator is open, drag its icon from the Launcher into the 'Applications' directory
