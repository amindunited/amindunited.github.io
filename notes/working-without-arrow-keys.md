# Working Without Arrow Keys

I've been using a 60% keyboard as an experiment, and I thought I would jot down some notes on working without arrow keys.


## VSCode

  All of these we tested in vscode on OSX

### Navigation
  - control-A: beginning of line.
  - control-E: (End) end of line.
  - control-B: (Backward) moves left
  - control-F: (Forward) moves right

  - control-P: moves up
  - control-N: moves down

### Deletion
  - control-H: delete char to the left
  - control-D: delete char to the right

  - control-K: delete from cursor to end of line.

  - ðŸ›‘ control-U: delete from cursor to beginning of line. (doesn't work) 
  - ðŸ›‘ control-W: delete word to the left. (doesn't work)

### Editing
  - control-T: (transpose) move characters around cursor.
  - control-O: (insert).
